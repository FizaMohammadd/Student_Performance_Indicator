# 🎓 Student Performance Indicator

A machine learning web application to predict student performance using academic and behavioral data. Developed using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**, with a real-time interactive interface built in **Streamlit**.

with Streamlit Interface this project can be titled as Student Performance Predictor.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Led a team of 3 to develop a robust machine learning model that predicts student performance based on academic and behavioral indicators. This project involved:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation using **Linear Regression**
- Deployment through an interactive **Streamlit** web application

After training and evaluation, the model achieved an accuracy of **88%** on the test dataset.

## 🌐 Streamlit Web Application

An easy-to-use frontend built with **Streamlit** allows real-time predictions through a form-based interface. Users can input key student data and receive an instant prediction of expected performance.

### 🖥️ How to Run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies

# 2. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
